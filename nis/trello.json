is my unified proposal for NEM distribution. I plan to announce this proposal after the public auditing of the stake holder list is over. There will be a refund period after the announcement so people can leave if they don't like what we are planning to do.   \n1. 10% of NEM is reserved for development team in which about 80-85% going to technical development and 15-20% going to promotional/ administrative tasks.\n2. 10% of NEM is reserved exclusively for giveaways/ charity/ and some support for node infrastructures. It will be distributed proportionally over at least 10 month period after the official launch. This part could be reduced to 5% but with anything smaller I think we won't have enough resources to expand the user-base as fast as we would like. \n3. For the raised fund in NXT, BTC if we already reserve a huge percentage of NEM for giveaways/ charity, I propose to reserve them for the development team allocated proportionally to development shares. So for anyone whose work deserve a development share, he/ she will also receive a portion of the raised fund accordingly. But to ensure the progress of NEM project, all the raised fund will be distributed only after the official launch of the blockchain.    \n4. As I proposed earlier, initially Jaguar on behalf of the core developers will be responsible for allocating technical development shares and I will be responsible for allocating promotional/ administrative shares using input from the community.      \n5.  We will seek community's proposals on how to best distribute 10% giveaway/ charity. A key criterion I would use to judge a proposal is the effective rate of conveting new users/ adopters, in the marketing jargon it is called CPA (cost per acquisition). I think we will have a board to oversee this effort but we could discuss this later when we are close to the launch.\n6. For regular stakes, we still have : NEM per stake = ( total NEM- development shares  - giveaway shares )/ total stakes.\n\nI would like to see your opinions on these principles and adjust them if necessary. If there is no objection, I will bring the proposal to promotion board in 1-2 days.

That's not good. Here is how Nxt does it:\n\n1) There is a base target for each round of forging. The higher the base targer the easier it is to forge a block (i. e. the time to the next block will be lower) and vice versa. The difficulty of the next block is (up to a factor of 2^64) the inverse of the base target. Thus in each round of forging the difficulty is set in stone. There will **never** be the situation that someone forges a block with higher difficulty at a later time.\n\n2) Then there is the cumulative difficulty which simply is the sum of all difficulties of the blocks in the chain so this cumulative difficulty always is a measure how difficult it was to create the chain as a whole.\n\n3) To test whether an account is allowed to forge, the client calculates a hit=hash(last block generation signuture + public key of account) and then evaluates hit < base target times balance times elapsed time since last block.\nIf that is true the account is allowed to forge.\n\nI would change 2 things in the nxt algorithm:\na) The base target of the next round is solely calculated from the old base target and the time that was needed to forge the last block. I think it would be better to include the average block generation time of the last n blocks where n is something like 10 (we would need to try out some values). This approach should smoothen the time between blocks. Nxt has a high variation in the generation time for blocks which is not good imo.\n\nb) In order to make the probability for forging proportional to the balance we would need to take the logarithm of the hit instead of the hit itself.

Are you sure we don't need something like cumulative difficulty?\n* If the block chain is 10000 blocks long, we have only 5000 blocks and the node we are syncing with has all blocks then we will never get any block from him I think. In region step 2 startingPoint would be 5000-720. the other node will supply all hashes from block 5000-720 to block 4999. Since we got all those block already the expression \"i == peerHashes.size()\" at line 255 will be true and the syncing ends. Am I wrong?\n\n2) What is the blockScore about and why is the block signature involved? People will start \"mining\" good scores by repeating the signing process.\nAlso the hit calculation should not involve any signature for the same reason. It has to rely on something that is not malleable like the hash of (last block hash + public key of the account)."},"type":"commentCard","date":"2014-04-04T10:31:45.745Z","memberCreator":{"id":"52f934b1884472487b65fd67","avatarHash":null,"fullName":"BloodyRookie","initials":"B","username":"bloodyrookie"}},{"id":"533e4ffb5661c5df3f456185","idMemberCreator":"52f882f477090b7f16b43ea6","data":{"dateLastEdited":"2014-04-04T06:30:12.808Z","textData":{"emoji":{}},"text":"@makoto1337 perfect answer.\n\nI'd say from one side it's interesting that he's interested in NEM, otoh, he's greatly connected to NXT, so I had serious doubts, when I've seen his post on bct.\n\nAlso it's quite interesting, cause they (CfB too) were promising whitepaper, and afaik it's still not there...\n\n@makoto1337 what you say about attacks have perfect sense\n(I think CfB uses \"Foo attacks\" on purpose, cause people feel bad hearing this, and most people are too lazy to actually check how does given \"Foo attack\" work.

Eclipse attack is where an attacker makes it so that a peer can only collaborate with them.\n\nSybil attack is the most obvious weakness in any reputation graph-based system, and I deal with that in my iPython notebook file analyzing different attacks (coin days can solve this problem). \n\nEclipse attacks are maybe less pertinent to POI. For example, some scammer could make it so that lots of people have to collaborate with their account (sending NEM, for instance). That alone wouldn't be enough to boost their importance, but they would have to send NEM to lots of other accounts as well.

this weekend trying to \"finish\" the trust stuff. I think I pulled in most of what you did in your branch (I'm sure a few things might still be missing like the taylor series convergence), did some other cleanup (e.g. the scores classes), and integrated it into the PeerNetwork so that nodes are now broadcasting their local experiences.\n\n@gimre take a look at PeerNetwork.getPartnerNode. I think it can be used for the block syncing (or at least that's the intent and if it can't be used I'll need to revisit :)). I think this can be pushed up into master because the remaining items are smaller and can be handled in one-off branches.

This works better if evil nodes are honest.\n* I didn't have time to integrate score classes and there are no test cases yet. I had to temporary comment out some tests for other classes as well because they conflict with the new design.\n* The highest failed calls percentage is achieved when evil nodes give 100% honest feedback and don't collude (Then Eigentrust++ essentially is as good as Eigentrust).

Since we choose alpha=0.05 it converges **very** slowly. If we take a bigger alpha, let's say alpha=0.5, it converges a lot faster but the resulting global trust vector favors the pretrusted nodes heavily and thus they get too many calls.\nI think we can iterate another way: Why not take the first n terms of the taylor series of (exp(trustmatrix) - I) and multiply it with the pretrust vector. The exponential series converges very fast. It really gives good results in my simulations.\n\nA few other things:\n\n* I didn't update the test code cause I didn't have the time to do so.\n* Your score classes are very neat, we should use them. They are more elegant than my implementation. I don't know if I have time to integrate them today.\n* I think the TrustContext should not make any trust calculation. There may be a method compute but the TrustContext should delegate the actual calculation to the TrustProvider implementation.

I had considered moving that to TrustContext.\n\n2) That sounds like a good idea.\n\n3) I think there's a slight misinterpretation of the TrustContext. It's purpose is to \"cement the way global trust values are calculated\" for EigenTrust-based trust algorithms.\n\nFor a completely different trust calculation procedure, I would expect to have a different context class and the trust context should really be an interface with that model (I left one out because we only have one procedure at the moment).\n\nAnd I see a simple facade on top of the trust stuff anyway. Something that returns nodes to communicate with.\n\nI do like that you're thinking through the open / closed aspects of design.

The provider should implement all calculations that are specific to the trust model.\nRight now the TrustContext class cements the way global trust values are calculated. If you had a new trust model which calculates global trust in a total different way (lets say not using the notion of local trust or feedbackCredibility and using no iteration like eigentrust does) then the TrustContext class has to be modified. That's not good. The TrustContext class should simply wrap the other classes. It's behavior should depend only on what trust provider you inject into the class.\nThe TrustContext supplies the trust provider with the nodes, the global node experiences, the pretrusted nodes and a set of constants like espilon, alpha, minTrust,...\nThe trust provider itself is then responsible for calculating all provider specific trust values.\n\nWhat do you think about it?"},"type":"commentCard","date":"2014-03-25T18:06:34.210Z","memberCreator":{"id":"52f934b1884472487b65fd67","avatarHash":null,"fullName":"BloodyRookie","initials":"B","username":"bloodyrookie"}},{"id":"5331a4fd3bd319f924ee043e","idMemberCreator":"52f934b1884472487b65fd67","data":{"board":{"shortLink":"7yK2DBY4","name":"NEM Board","id":"52f66781b6f4932831b054b1"},"card":{"shortLink":"HcthOlAF","idShort":131,"name":"Sync 3/22","id":"532d8937473df4de43c31420"},"text":"@gimre :The verification must be dynamic.

Those nodes should be given a good chance to communicate with other node even if they are unknown in the moment they join. Most of the stakeholders will hopefully do that and evil nodes would at least have to buy some nem.\n* A node can identify itself by proving it owns an account but has 0 nem on that account. Those nodes should be given a smaller chance to communicate with other node if they just joined the network. Owners of evil nodes would not have to buy nem but at least have an account.\n* A node can refuse to identify itself. Then it is identified by its ip.

I think the network simulator is handy, but I would prefer to keep it under test since it is primarily used for testing\n* I will need to reread the Eigentrust++ paper.\n* I finished refactoring the EigenTrust code (the EigenTrust++ is done except for the feedback credibility calculation). I ran a few tests and the numbers seem to be consistent with your results. However, I noticed that the EigenTrust calculation isn't converging that fast. There seem to be a number of times that it doesn't converge after 1000 iterations. I haven't had a chance to debug this yet. \n* I'm not sure if I would call your code minimalistic. The core algorithm implementation seemed to be correct. It was somewhat coupled with the original peering classes and I needed to make changes to use the new classes. As part of that effort, I added a few enhancements, a bunch of tests, and made it more SOLID (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID_(object-oriented_design)). Just the S of SOLID simplifies a codebase dramatically :)."},"type":"commentCard","date":"2014-03-25T03:44:27.831Z","memberCreator":{"id":"52f666ecd04a60877b479117","avatarHash":null,"fullName":"Jaguar0625","initials":"J","username":"jaguar0625"}},{"id":"5330a9ca3bd319f924ed5834","idMemberCreator":"52f666ecd04a60877b479117","data":{"board":{"shortLink":"7yK2DBY4","name":"NEM Board","id":"52f66781b6f4932831b054b1"},"card":{"shortLink":"BSPKA96W","idShort":133,"name":"accountanalyzer inside HttpMethodClient","id":"53306d88eb1165e14f426996"},"text":"How about this?\n\nLet's move away from using PeerNetworkHost.getDefaultHost() and instead have a NemNetworkHost in NisMain.

In a technical sense, to the network sending 1 million NEM is no different from sending 1 NEM, and NXT solution is to impose a rigid minimum fee =1. The flat percentage fee would require the former pay at least 1000 NEM instead of 1.This will bring in substantial fee to the foragers compares to NXT. This could have a nice long term implication. IMO, fee structure design should consider: 1. user's experience concern; 2. technical concerns as Jaguar points out including spam prevention+ sufficient incentives to foragers; 3. some progressive ideas if desired.

I think these results show that POI should be reasonably safe as long as we incorporate coindays to weight nodes and edges of the transaction graph. Without coindays there is the infinite loop exploit where people can just send coins around in a loop (assuming negligible transaction fees).\n\nPlease let me know what other types of attacks you can think of. I will try to come up with more, too. Overall, these results are very early and we will probably modify the algorithm more in the future. However, already these results are very promising. \n\nI especially like the results of the first example where everyone has the same balances. POS would give all these nodes the same weight, but obviously some of these accounts are more important than others, because of how they interact with other accounts.

Here are my initial comments:\n\n* Does it make sense to check in the code in the NIS repository. That would make collaborating a little easier IMO. Or, do you think it's better to try different things on IPython?\n* In the PageRank definition, it looks like the definition is for weighted page rank (since w is present). The original page rank is unweighted\n*  You seem to be essentially using mu instead of a damping factor. Your hypothesis is that people with more NEM are more likely to trade with random accounts, but I'm not sure if I agree with that.\n* How are you normalizing mu; so that the sum of all mu is 1?\n* I'm unsure if a product of POI(in) and OW makes sense; it might be too harsh. And, I would like to see different types of combinations (e.g. average, weighted average).\n* I'm not sure I understand the intuition of the outflux calculation. Why is it interesting?\n* We definitely need to run tests on non uniform networks. As a starting point, I think it makes sense to take a random sample of the NXT network.\n* What is the danglesum for in the python code?\n* Can we use matrix and vector classes to simplify the code at this stage?\n* Do we know when the power iteration can fail to converge?\n* I think it would be helpful to print out the POI component scores (POI and OW)."},"type":"commentCard","date":"2014-03-13T22:23:19.651Z","memberCreator":{"id":"52f666ecd04a60877b479117","avatarHash":null,"fullName":"Jaguar0625","initials":"J","username":"jaguar0625"}},{"id":"53222b6fd8e764a5794c71c9","idMemberCreator":"52f666ecd04a60877b479117","data":{"board":{"shortLink":"7yK2DBY4","name":"NEM Board","id":"52f66781b6f4932831b054b1"},"card":{"shortLink":"1Wo7W6iU","idShort":112,"name":"JDK 8?","id":"5320e1b0f01203406e8af423"},"text":"Yea.

I don't want to just calculate the PageRank for outlinks because then someone could boost their score just by transacting with important nodes.\n\nIt seems like you want to weight two things as a measure of outlinks:\n\n1. The median transaction size (makes sense to use a median because it is more resilient to outliers)\n2. The outlinks (I assume these will be weighted too?)\n\nI think it's a consequence of PageRank that, all other things equal, a transaction from a node with a higher PR will cause the accrued PR of the recipient to be higher too. \n\nIn other words, if A has a PR of 10000 and sends a transaction to B, B's PR will be higher than if A initially had a PR of 1000.\n\nGranted, this is on the inlink side. Presumably, a malicious actor wouldn't be able to control one of these high PR nodes. So, I guess that's why you're not proposing any additional dampening on the inlink side. Although, if B could pick what account to buy from, I think it would be the same thing as the outlink case.\n\nI guess my question is, on the outlink side, how do you envision the median transaction size having a dampening* effect on the outlink score? Do you think we might need something on the inlink side too?\n\n*I'm just referring to the fact that including median transaction size in the outlink calculation should moderate the changes somewhat."},"type":"commentCard","date":"2014-03-06T04:27:11.979Z","memberCreator":{"id":"52f666ecd04a60877b479117","avatarHash":null,"fullName":"Jaguar0625","initials":"J","username":"jaguar0625"}},{"id":"5317f672d70d06897548df45","idMemberCreator":"52f841f881c38e886e2d306d","data":{"board":{"shortLink":"7yK2DBY4","name":"NEM Board","id":"52f66781b6f4932831b054b1"},"card":{"shortLink":"DBRtNKU4","idShort":97,"name":"I am glad to join the team. :-)","id":"5317f6057afd6c1a6d48e02f"},"text":"@neohe is the operator of nxt-e.com.
