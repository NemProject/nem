writing code which can be incorporated into nis itself.

Following these guidelines helps to communicate that you respect the time of

they should reciprocate that respect in addressing your issue, assessing changes,

Please, **don't use the issue tracker for support questions**.

## Bug reports

If you think you have found a bug in nis, first make sure that you
are testing against the latest version of nis - your issue may already
have been fixed. If not, search our issues list on GitHub in case a similar
issue has already been opened.

It is very helpful if you can prepare a reproduction of the bug. In other words,
provide a small test case which we can run to confirm your bug. It makes it easier to
find the problem and to fix it.

Please, take in consideration the following template to report your issue:

> **Expected Behavior**\

> **Steps to reproduce**\

## Contributing code and documentation changes

If you have a bugfix or new feature that you would like to contribute to nis, please find or open an issue
about it first. Talk about what you would like to do. It may be that somebody is already working on it, or that there
are particular issues that you should know about before implementing the change.

We enjoy working with contributors to get their code accepted. There are many approaches to fixing a problem and it is
important to find the best approach before writing too much code.

### Submitting your changes

1. Make sure your code meets coding style (Find the rules in [`eclipse-formatter.xml`](eclipse-formatter.xml)).
2. Run the lint tool `mvn spotless:check` and `mvn spotless:apply`.
3. Code without corresponding tests will not be accepted.
